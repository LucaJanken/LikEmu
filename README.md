# LikEmu

LikEmu is an iterative likelihood emulation framework designed to efficiently approximate and emulate complex likelihood functions. It leverages surrogate neural network models and MCMC sampling to iteratively refine its approximations, making it especially useful in statistical modeling and cosmological applications.
